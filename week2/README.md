# Goals
- Background estimation
    - Model the background pixels of a video sequence using a simple statistical model to classify the background / foreground
        - Single Gaussian per pixel
        - Adaptive / Non-adaptive
    - The statistical model will be used to preliminary classify foreground
- Comparison with more complex mode

# Tasks
- Task 1.1: Gaussian distribution
- Task 1.2 & 1.3: Evaluate results
- Task 2.1: Recursive Gaussian modeling
- Task 2.2: Evaluate and compare to non-recursive
- Task 3: Compare with state-of-the-art
- Task 4: Color sequences
