# Road traffic monitoring

[Module 6][m6] Project from [Master in Computer Vision Barcelona][master] program.

The goal of this project is to learn the basic concepts and techniques related to video
sequences mainly for surveillance applications

# Scope
- Use of statistical models to estimate the background information of 
the video sequence
- Use of deep learning techniques to detect the foreground
- Use optical flow estimations and compensations
- Track detections
- Analyze system performance evaluation

# Applicability

Any problem where video sequence analysis can be applied to obtain 
accurate automatic results
