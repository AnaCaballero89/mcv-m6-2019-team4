# Road traffic monitoring

[Module 6][m6] Project from [Master in Computer Vision Barcelona][master] program.

The goal of this project is to learn the basic concepts and techniques related to video
sequences mainly for surveillance applications

# Scope
- Use of statistical models to estimate the background information of 
the video sequence
- Use of deep learning techniques to detect the foreground
- Use optical flow estimations and compensations
- Track detections
- Analyze system performance evaluation

# Applicability

Any problem where video sequence analysis can be applied to obtain 
accurate automatic results 

# How to run

Package dependencies are managed using _pipenv_. Check 
[its documentation][pipenv_docs] or [its repository][pipenv_repo].

For every week there are a group of tasks to do. They can be found organized
in package and modules for weeks and tasks respectively, i.e. `week1\task1.py`.
All of them can be run from `main.py` which is used to collect all work done.
